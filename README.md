# land-registry-search

An excuse to play with elasticsearch over the holidays.

The intent is to ingest the land registry price paid data so that it can be
queried in various ways.

## TODO

* CSV parse and ingest into elasticsearch
* Query API
* Some sort of frontend?
* Multi-mod project to separate ingest from query service
